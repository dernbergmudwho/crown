Fallout: The Frontier is a fan-made mod for Fallout: New Vegas that adds a new map, story, and gameplay elements. The mod is set in Portland, Oregon, where a harsh winter has turned the city into a frozen wasteland. The mod features three main factions: the NCR, the Legion, and the Crusaders of Steel. Each faction has its own storyline, quests, and characters. The mod also introduces new weapons, vehicles, enemies, and mechanics.
 
The Frontier is the result of a seven-year project by a team of dozens of community members who wanted to create a new game-sized modification for Fallout: New Vegas. The mod is free to download and play for anyone who owns Fallout: New Vegas and its DLCs. The mod was released on January 15, 2021, and has received over 1.5 million downloads and positive reviews from players and critics. The mod is still being updated and improved by the developers, who plan to add more content and features in the future.
 
To download and install Fallout: The Frontier, players will need to visit [the official Nexus Mods page](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/68009/) and follow the instructions. The mod requires a clean installation of Fallout: New Vegas and its DLCs, as well as some other mods that are listed on the page. The mod also has its own launcher that allows players to customize their settings and preferences.
