## Step 1: Download the DirectX 9 version of Resident Evil 5
 
The first step is to download the DirectX 9 version of Resident Evil 5 from a reliable source. You can find it on various websites, such as [Gamepressure](https://www.gamepressure.com/download.asp?ID=24669) or [ModDB](https://www.moddb.com/games/resident-evil-5/downloads/resident-evil-5-directx-9-version). The file size is about 1.3 GB and it contains the necessary files to run the game on DirectX 9. Make sure you have enough space on your hard drive before downloading it.
 
## Step 2: Extract the downloaded file to your game folder
 
The next step is to extract the downloaded file to your game folder. You can use any file extraction software, such as [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0) or [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/). To do this, right-click on the downloaded file and select "Extract here" or "Extract to Resident Evil 5 DirectX 9 Version". You should see a new folder named "Resident Evil 5 DirectX 9 Version" in your game folder. This folder contains the files that will replace the original ones in order to run the game on DirectX 9.
 
## Step 3: Backup your original game files
 
Before you replace the original game files with the DirectX 9 ones, it is recommended that you backup your original game files in case something goes wrong or you want to revert back to DirectX 10 or 11. To do this, copy and paste the following files from your game folder to another location:
 
- re5dx10.exe
- xlive.dll
- xlive\_d.dll
- xlivefnt.dll
- xliveinstall.dll
- xliveinstallhost.exe

You can also rename these files instead of copying them, for example by adding ".bak" at the end of their names.
 
## Step 4: Replace the original game files with the DirectX 9 ones
 
The final step is to replace the original game files with the DirectX 9 ones. To do this, copy and paste the following files from the "Resident Evil 5 DirectX 9 Version" folder to your game folder:

- re5dx9.exe
- d3d9.dll
- xinput1\_3.dll
- xlive.dll
- xlive\_d.dll
- xlivefnt.dll
- xliveinstall.dll
- xliveinstallhost.exe

You may be asked to overwrite or replace some files. Choose "Yes" or "Replace" when prompted.
 
## Step 5: Run the game on DirectX 9
 
Now you are ready to run the game on DirectX 9. To do this, double-click on re5dx9.exe in your game folder. The game should launch normally and you should see a message saying "DirectX Version: DX9" in the bottom left corner of the screen. You can also check your graphics settings in the game menu and make sure they are set to DirectX 9.
