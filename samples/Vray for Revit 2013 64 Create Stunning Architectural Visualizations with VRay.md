With V-Ray 6 for Revit, you can take advantage of the new features and improvements that make rendering faster, easier, and more realistic. Some of the highlights include:
 
- Cloudy skies and timelapses: You can easily create realistic skies with clouds and sun settings, and animate them over time to create stunning timelapses.
- Decals: You can place decals on any surface in your scene, such as logos, signs, graffiti, or dirt. Decals are non-destructive and do not affect your BIM data or performance.
- Enscape import: You can import Enscape data into V-Ray for Revit, and use it as a starting point for your rendering. This allows you to collaborate with other designers who use Enscape, and leverage their work.
- Chaos Cloud: You can render your scenes on the cloud with a single click, and get high-quality images and animations without using your own hardware. You can also review your renders online, share them with others, and make adjustments on the fly.
