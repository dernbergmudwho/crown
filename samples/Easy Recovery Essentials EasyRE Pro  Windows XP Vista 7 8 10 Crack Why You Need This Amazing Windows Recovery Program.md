You can follow these instructions[^1^] on how to burn the bootable ISO image very carefully, as making a bootable CD can be tricky. Alternatively, you can follow these instructions[^1^] on how to create a bootable EasyRE recovery USB stick/drive.
 
## Step 2: Boot your PC from EasyRE Pro media
 
Once you have created the EasyRE Pro bootable media, you need to boot your PC from it. To do this, you need to change the boot order in your BIOS or UEFI settings. You can usually access these settings by pressing a certain key (such as F2, F12, Del, Esc) during the initial startup of your PC. The exact key and procedure may vary depending on your PC model and manufacturer, so check your user manual or online documentation for more details.
 
After changing the boot order to make your CD or USB drive the first boot device, save the changes and exit the BIOS or UEFI settings. Your PC should then restart and boot from the EasyRE Pro media.
 
## Step 3: Run Automated Repair and recover your Windows system
 
When your PC boots from the EasyRE Pro media, you will see a welcome screen with some options. Choose "Automated Repair" and click "Continue".
