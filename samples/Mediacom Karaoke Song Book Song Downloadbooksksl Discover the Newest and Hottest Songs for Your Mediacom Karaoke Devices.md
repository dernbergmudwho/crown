If you love singing karaoke songs, you might want to have a digital songbook app that lets you access thousands of songs from different languages and genres. Mediacom Karaoke Song Book App is one such app that allows you to have a digital file and view the karaoke songlist of different models of Mediacom Karaoke players. You can sort the list by song title, by artist, and even create a playlist of all your favorite songs and save it in your phone. This app eliminates the inconvenience of carrying big and bulky songbooks that keep on getting heavier every time there is an update or new releases. The app automatically updates the songlist to its latest version when you are connected to wifi.
 
As an additional option, you can also play the music video version of the selected titles by just clicking on the number of the song title and the app will automatically link to YouTube, the most popular online music site and play the music video. However, this app is not a karaoke player but just a songbook application that provides you with the list of popular songs available for karaoke singing. If you wish to play your favorite songs on music video format, this app merely provides the link to YouTube for audio and video streaming the selected songs which are free on the website.
