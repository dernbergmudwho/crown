AutoCAD Electrical 2017 also has automatic wire numbering and component tagging features that help you assign unique identifiers to wires and components in your drawings. You can customize the format and style of these identifiers according to your preferences or industry standards. You can also use the Wire Number Annotation command to add annotations to wires that show their source and destination.
 
Another useful feature of AutoCAD Electrical 2017 is the ability to create PLC I/O drawings from spreadsheets automatically. You can import a spreadsheet that contains PLC I/O data into AutoCAD Electrical 2017 and use the PLC Database File command to generate a PLC I/O drawing that shows the connections between the PLC modules and the field devices. You can also edit the PLC I/O data in AutoCAD Electrical 2017 and export it back to the spreadsheet.
 
## Generating Reports
 
AutoCAD Electrical 2017 can help you generate various reports that provide useful information about your electrical control systems. For example, you can generate a bill of materials (BOM) report that lists all the components used in your drawings along with their quantities, descriptions, and costs. You can also generate a wire list report that shows all the wires in your drawings along with their numbers, colors, sizes, and lengths. Other types of reports include terminal strip reports, cable summary reports, panel layout reports, and more.
 
You can access these reports by using the Reports command or the Report Generator tool. You can customize the content and format of these reports according to your needs or industry standards. You can also export these reports to various formats such as PDF, TXT, CSV, or XML.

## Checking Errors
 
AutoCAD Electrical 2017 has a real-time error checking feature that helps you detect and correct errors in your drawings as you work. It can check for errors such as duplicate wire numbers, missing wire numbers, unconnected wires, mismatched wire types, invalid component tags, missing component tags, duplicate component tags, and more. It can also check for errors related to coil and contact cross-referencing, such as missing contacts, mismatched contacts, or unused coils.
 
You can enable or disable this feature by using the Error Check command or the Error Check Settings dialog box. You can also use the Error Check Results dialog box to view a list of errors found in your drawings and fix them individually or in batch mode.
 
## Sharing Designs with Others
 
AutoCAD Electrical 2017 allows you to share your designs with customers and suppliers and track their changes using the eTransmit command or the Autodesk Vault software. The eTransmit command helps you create a compressed package of your drawings and related files that you can send to others via email or other methods. The Autodesk Vault software helps you manage your design data in a secure central location that enables collaboration between design teams.
 
You can also use AutoCAD Electrical 2017 to create smart panel layout drawings that show the physical arrangement of components on a panel board. You can use these drawings to communicate with panel fabricators or installers who need to assemble or mount the components on the panel board. You can create these drawings by using the Panel Layout command or the Panel Layout tools.
 
### Conclusion
 
AutoCAD Electrical 2017 is a powerful software that helps you design and modify electrical control systems efficiently and accurately. It has many features and benefits
