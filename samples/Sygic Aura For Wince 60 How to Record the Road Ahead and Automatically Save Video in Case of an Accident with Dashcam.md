## Step 1: Check if your device supports OpenGL SE
 
The first step is to check if your device supports OpenGL SE or not. You can do this by downloading and running a simple test program called [GLBenchmark](https://www.navitotal.com/sygic-system-f137/sygic-aura-wince-t6066.html) [^1^]. If the program runs smoothly and shows a rotating cube, then your device supports OpenGL SE and you can skip to step 3. If the program crashes or shows a black screen, then your device does not support OpenGL SE and you need to follow step 2.
 
## Step 2: Install an OpenGL SE driver
 
If your device does not support OpenGL SE, you need to install an OpenGL SE driver that will enable your device to run Sygic Aura. There are different drivers available for different devices, so you need to find the one that matches your device model and resolution. You can search for the drivers on [this website](https://trello.com/c/P4yIpuxJ/42-verified-32-sygic-aura-for-wince-60-activation-cracked-windows-free) [^3^] or [this website](https://sway.office.com/qz939mYeGJNrOwz5) [^2^]. Once you find the driver, download it and copy it to your device's memory card. Then, run the driver installation file and follow the instructions. After the installation is complete, restart your device.
