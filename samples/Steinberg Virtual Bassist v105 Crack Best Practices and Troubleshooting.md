One of the main strengths of Steinberg Virtual Bassist V1.0.5 is its variety of styles and parts. The styles cover a broad spectrum of contemporary music genres, from rock, blues, country and jazz to funk, soul, disco and hip hop. Each style has a suitable preset bass sound associated with it, but you can also tweak the sound using the Amp & FX section or change the bass model altogether. The parts range from simple root notes and octaves to complex riffs and fills, with different levels of complexity and variation. You can switch between parts using your MIDI keyboard or mouse, creating dynamic and interesting bass lines on the fly.
 
Another key feature of Steinberg Virtual Bassist V1.0.5 is its Groove Match function. This allows you to adjust the timing and feel of the bass line to match any existing drum groove, whether it is from a MIDI file, an audio loop or a live performance. You can also use Groove Match to sync Virtual Bassist with other Steinberg products, such as Groove Agent, Virtual Guitarist or Virtual Guitarist Electric Edition, creating a complete virtual band that plays in perfect harmony. Groove Match is easy to use and can produce impressive results with minimal effort.
