V-Ray 2.40.03 is a powerful rendering solution that will help you create stunning images with 3ds Max 2013. Whether you are working on architectural visualization, product design, animation, or visual effects, you will find that V-Ray 2.40.03 can handle any challenge and deliver amazing results.
  
One of the advantages of V-Ray 2.40.03 is that it supports both CPU and GPU rendering modes, which means you can choose the best option for your hardware and project. CPU rendering is more compatible and stable, while GPU rendering is faster and more interactive. You can also use both modes together with V-Ray RT, which is a real-time rendering system that lets you preview your scene in the viewport or a separate window. V-Ray RT can also run on multiple GPUs and across a network of machines with V-Ray Swarm.
  
V-Ray 2.40.03 also comes with a rich set of materials and textures that can help you create realistic and stylized surfaces for your models. You can use the VRayMtl, which is a versatile material that supports diffuse, reflection, refraction, glossiness, bump, displacement, and subsurface scattering. You can also use the VRayCarPaintMtl, which is a new material that simulates car paint with metallic flakes and clear coat layer. Other materials include VRayFastSSS2 for skin and organic objects, VRaySkinMtl for human skin, VRayToonMtl for cartoon effects, VRayBlendMtl for blending multiple materials, VRayBumpMtl for adding bump maps without affecting the base material, and VRayWrapperMtl for compositing objects over a background.
  
Another feature of V-Ray 2.40.03 is that it supports various types of lights and shadows that can enhance the mood and realism of your scene. You can use the VRayLight, which is a multipurpose light that can act as a point light, spot light, directional light, dome light, or mesh light. You can also use the VRaySun and VRaySky for simulating natural daylight and sky illumination. Other light types include VRayIES for photometric lights, VRayAmbientLight for ambient occlusion effects, VRayLightSelect for isolating individual lights in post-production, and VRayLensEffects for adding glow and glare effects to bright areas.
