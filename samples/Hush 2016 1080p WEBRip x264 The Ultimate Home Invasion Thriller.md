The film is a tense and gripping thriller that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The film uses minimal dialogue and relies on sound design and visual cues to create a sense of dread and suspense. The film also subverts some of the clichÃ©s of the slasher genre, such as the final girl trope and the killer's motive. The film explores themes of isolation, vulnerability, and empowerment, as Maddie faces her fears and challenges her limitations.
 
Hush is a well-crafted and original horror film that delivers a satisfying and exhilarating experience. The film has received positive reviews from critics and audiences alike, and has been praised for its direction, performances, script, and atmosphere. The film is available to stream on Netflix in 1080p WEBRip x264 quality.
  
The film also features Michael Trucco as John, Maddie's neighbor and friend, who tries to help her when he sees the killer outside her house. Samantha Sloyan plays Sarah, John's wife and Maddie's friend, who is the first victim of the killer. Emilia "Emma" Graves plays Max, Maddie's cat, who provides some comic relief and emotional support for Maddie.
 
The film was shot in 18 days on a low budget of $1 million. The film was inspired by the 1967 film Wait Until Dark, starring Audrey Hepburn as a blind woman who is terrorized by intruders in her apartment. Flanagan and Siegel wanted to create a similar scenario with a deaf protagonist and a home invasion plot. Flanagan also drew inspiration from his own experience of living in a remote area and being afraid of someone breaking into his house.
 
The film premiered at South by Southwest on March 12, 2016, and was acquired by Netflix shortly after. The film was released worldwide on Netflix on April 8, 2016. The film has received critical acclaim and has been hailed as one of the best horror films of 2016. The film has a 93% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 83 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10. The site's consensus reads: "Hush navigates the bloody waters of home invasion thrillers and incisive slashers for a contemporary horror puree."
  
The film also showcases the talent and versatility of Kate Siegel, who delivers a powerful and nuanced performance as Maddie. Siegel portrays Maddie as a strong and resourceful heroine who does not let her disability define her. Siegel also conveys Maddie's emotions and thoughts through facial expressions, body language, and sign language. Siegel learned American Sign Language for the role and worked with a deaf consultant to ensure accuracy and authenticity.
 
John Gallagher Jr. is equally impressive as the unnamed killer, who is both menacing and charismatic. Gallagher Jr. plays the killer as a sadistic and cunning psychopath who enjoys toying with his prey. Gallagher Jr. also adds some layers of complexity and mystery to his character, as he reveals some hints of his backstory and motivation throughout the film. Gallagher Jr. wears a white mask for most of the film, which adds to his creepiness and unpredictability.
