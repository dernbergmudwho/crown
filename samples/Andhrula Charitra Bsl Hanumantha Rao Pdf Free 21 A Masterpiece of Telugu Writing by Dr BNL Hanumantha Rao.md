## The Mauryan and Satavahana Periods
 
The earliest historical evidence of Andhra Pradesh dates back to the Mauryan dynasty, which ruled over most of northern India from the late 4th to the early 2nd century BCE. The Mauryan emperor Ashoka sent Buddhist missions to the Andhras in the south and also erected some of his famous edicts in their territory. The Andhras were known for their trade and commerce, especially with the Roman Empire. They also developed a distinctive culture and art, influenced by Buddhism and local traditions.
 
After the decline of the Mauryan empire, the Andhras established their own independent kingdom under the Satavahana dynasty, which lasted from about the 1st century BCE to the 3rd century CE. The Satavahanas were one of the most powerful and prosperous dynasties in Indian history, ruling over almost the entire Deccan plateau and parts of central and eastern India. They patronized various religions, including Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism, and supported literature, art and architecture. Their capital city, Amaravati, was a major centre of Buddhist learning and culture, where the famous philosopher Nagarjuna taught. The Satavahanas also maintained trade relations with foreign countries, such as Rome, China and Southeast Asia.
  
## The Medieval Period
 
The fall of the Satavahana dynasty led to a period of political fragmentation and instability in Andhra Pradesh. Several local dynasties emerged and competed for supremacy, such as the Ikshvakus, the Pallavas, the Vishnukundins, the Vakatakas, the Chalukyas and the Rashtrakutas. These dynasties contributed to the cultural development of Andhra Pradesh by promoting Hinduism, especially Shaivism and Vaishnavism, and by building temples, sculptures and paintings. They also encouraged Telugu literature and poetry, which flourished under poets like Nannaya, who translated the Sanskrit epic Mahabharata into Telugu.
 
The most prominent dynasty that unified most of Andhra Pradesh in the medieval period was the Eastern Chalukya dynasty, which ruled from the 7th to the 12th century CE. The Eastern Chalukyas were descendants of the Western Chalukyas of Karnataka, who expanded their influence to the east. They established their capital at Vengi (near Eluru) and later at Rajahmundry. They were known for their military prowess, administrative efficiency and cultural achievements. They patronized education, literature, art and architecture. They also fostered a harmonious relationship between Hinduism and Buddhism.
