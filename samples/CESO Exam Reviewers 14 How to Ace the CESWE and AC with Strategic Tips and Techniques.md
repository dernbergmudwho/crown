If you are planning to take the CESO exam, you might be wondering how to prepare for it and what resources to use. Here are some tips and resources that might help you ace the exam:
 
- Review the exam coverage and competencies. The CESO written examination covers four areas: analytical ability, leadership potential, managerial effectiveness, and values orientation. The exam also measures 14 competencies that are essential for executive leadership: strategic thinking, problem solving, decision making, planning and organizing, directing and controlling, motivating and empowering, communicating effectively, building collaborative relationships, developing self and others, managing change and innovation, managing performance and accountability, demonstrating personal effectiveness, upholding public interest and constitutionalism, and promoting nationalism and patriotism. You can find more details about the exam coverage and competencies on the [CES Board website](https://www.cesboard.gov.ph/ces-eligibility-examination-process/).
- Study relevant materials and sources. There are various materials and sources that you can use to review for the CESO exam. Some of them are:
    - Civil Service Exam Reviewers. The CESO written examination is similar to the civil service exam for professional level in terms of format and difficulty. You can use civil service exam reviewers to practice your analytical ability, verbal reasoning, numerical reasoning, general information, and values orientation. You can find some civil service exam reviewers online such as [this one](https://1taker.com/civil-service-exam-complete-reviewer-philippines/) or [this one](https://www.academia.edu/26969846/Civil_Service_Exam_Reviewer_For_Professional_and_Sub_Professional_Levels_2014_Edition).
    - Management Books and Journals. The CESO written examination also tests your knowledge and skills in management concepts, theories, and practices. You can read books and journals on topics such as strategic management, organizational behavior, human resource management, financial management, public administration, governance, ethics, leadership, and innovation. You can also refer to the [CES Reading List](https://www.cesboard.gov.ph/ces-reading-list/) provided by the CES Board for some recommended readings.
    - Current Events and Issues. The CESO written examination also requires you to be updated on current events and issues that affect the country and the world. You can read newspapers, magazines, websites, blogs, podcasts, or watch news programs that cover topics such as politics, economics, social issues, culture, environment, security, foreign affairs, and development. You can also use online sources such as [Google News](https://news.google.com/) or [Rappler](https://www.rappler.com/) to browse through different news sources.
- Practice answering sample questions and mock tests. One of the best ways to prepare for the CESO exam is to practice answering sample questions and mock tests that simulate the actual exam. This will help you familiarize yourself with the exam format, time pressure, question types, and difficulty level. You can also check your answers and identify your strengths and weaknesses. You can find some sample questions and mock tests online such as [this one](https://seesaawiki.jp/rutnoredogt/d/Ceso%20Exam%20Reviewers%2014) or [this one](https://michaelsuzonpedrosvlog809249347.wordpress.com/category/civil-service-reviewer/).
