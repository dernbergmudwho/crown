## Lotr Bfme 1 Tips and Tricks
 
Now that you have fixed Lotr Bfme 1 crack issue, you might be wondering how to improve your skills and strategies in the game. Whether you are playing the good or evil campaign, or challenging other players online, you will need some tips and tricks to gain an edge over your enemies. Here are some of the best Lotr Bfme 1 tips and tricks that will help you win more battles:

- Build your economy fast. Resources are essential for creating units and buildings, so you should always prioritize building farms or slaughterhouses as soon as possible. Try to capture as many camping spots as you can and fill them with resource collectors. Defend your collectors with some units or towers, but don't overdo it. You need to balance your economy and your army.
- Use control groups. Control groups are a handy way to select and command specific units or buildings quickly. You can create a control group by selecting a group of units or buildings and pressing CTRL + a number. Then, you can select that group by pressing that number. You can also assign hotkeys to certain buildings or abilities by right-clicking on them and choosing a key. This will save you time and make your actions more efficient.
- Know your units and heroes. Each side has unique units and heroes with different strengths and weaknesses. You should familiarize yourself with their abilities and roles in combat. For example, Rohan's Rohirrim are fast cavalry that can trample infantry, but are vulnerable to pikemen and archers. Isengard's Uruk-hai are strong melee fighters that can upgrade their armor and weapons, but are slow and expensive. Mordor's orcs are cheap and numerous, but weak and cowardly. Gondor's soldiers are versatile and well-rounded, but lack special abilities. Heroes are powerful units that can turn the tide of battle with their special skills. They can level up by killing enemies and gain new abilities as they do so. You should always have at least one hero in your army and use their skills wisely.
- Use formations and stances. You can change the formation and stance of your units by clicking on the buttons at the bottom of the screen. Formations affect how your units move and fight in groups. For example, wedge formation increases the speed and damage of cavalry, while line formation increases the range and defense of archers. Stances affect how your units behave in combat. For example, aggressive stance makes your units attack any enemy they see, while defensive stance makes them hold their ground and fight back only when attacked. You should use formations and stances according to the situation and your strategy.
- Use Evenstar or One Ring powers. Depending on your alignment, you can use Evenstar powers (for good) or One Ring powers (for evil) to unleash devastating effects on the battlefield. You can access these powers by clicking on the star or ring icon at the top of the screen. You need to earn power points by killing enemies or completing objectives to unlock new powers. Some powers are passive, while others are active. You should use these powers carefully, as they have long cooldowns and can make a big difference in the outcome of the battle.

These are some of the basic Lotr Bfme 1 tips and tricks that will help you improve your game play. Of course, there is more to learn and master in this complex and exciting game, so you should practice a lot and experiment with different strategies and tactics. Have fun playing Lotr Bfme 1!
